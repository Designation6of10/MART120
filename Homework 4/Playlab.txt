I really did not enjoy the playlab. Customization is practically nonexistant, you can do basically nothing with projectiles,
and the playing field is so small a mouse would feel cramped inside. Every concept I came up with was impossible due to the limited nature
of the lab. (I couldn't even make a really simple snowball fight because projectiles have no way of registering collisions!)
