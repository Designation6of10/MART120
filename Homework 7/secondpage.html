        The Journal of Marah the Bloodless
    </div>
    <div class="journalText">
    <br />After the discovery of my father's journal, I decided it would be prudent to document my own 
    development in the dark arts, specifically in those developments that are, to my knowledge, wholly 
    unique to myself. As such, the following is a short list of spells, developed by either my father 
    or myself, which take advantage of the unique nature of my disposition [see the Ferryman's Lantern],
     and/or require it to function properly.
     <p></p>
     The first such spell is my father's, having become a sort of signature of his. There is a saying 
     in my homeland, "The mists are the veil that separate this world from the next. Woe to he who 
     walks among them, for his soul be already claimed." This of course was the inspiration for his 
     most powerful necromantic spell: Misty Veil.
     <p></p>
     The spell is simple in nature. It manifests a mist from the ground, spreading outward from one's 
     feet. Any who touch it immediately feel the chill of the grave, their bodies slowing as their 
     heartbeat fades. It is a quiet and painless death, capable of claiming thousands, even millions, 
     and was responsible for a vast majority of my father's destruction, as well as being his preferred 
     tool of the harvest.
     <br />
     There are some notable disadvantages to Misty Veil, however. It is slow, spreading at a rate far 
     too predictable to be useful in battle, and its spreading cannot be controlled beyond halting its 
     movement, making it inadequate for ambush. Additionally, the spell does not kill instantly, often 
     taking entire minutes to drain the life from a target, allowing too much opportunity to escape. 
     Above all else, the spell is useless during the day, as it dissolves under the heat of the sun or 
     a great flame. A city prepared for such an attack need only line the streets with lit braziers at 
     night to protect its citizenry.
     <p></p>
     The second spell was also discovered by my father. It carries a power far more potent than Misty 
     Veil, and is far more versatile a tool for the harvest. However, he lacked the ability to cast 
     this spell for one simple reason: he was male.
     <br />
     The Cry of the Banshee is a wide-area acoustic manipulation spell that causes various effects 
     depending upon the power used to cast it, the nature of its target, and its intended effect. The 
     caster, in this case myself, releases a deafening screech that carries through the air in all 
     directions, bringing death to all who hear it. It can be used to cause total organ failure in any 
     subject within its range biologically capable of hearing, regardless of acoustic protection or 
     temporary disability. Alternatively, if I so choose, victims subjected to the cry may become sickly. 
     Their ears will ring with an echo of the cry, causing terrible headaches, as well as fitful sleep 
     drought with nightmares of death. Many become paranoid, expecting anything and everything to kill 
     them at any moment. This curse lasts either until I dismiss it myself, or the victim dies, at which 
     point their soul is absorbed, regardless of cause, so long as I am within range to harvest it.
